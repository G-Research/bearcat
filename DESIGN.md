# Designing Bearcat: a work in progress

## Initial usage sketch

Given initial code:

```python
import pandas as pd

def run():
    df = pd.from_csv("my.csv")
    intermediate_df = df.transform().another_transform()
    result = intermediate_df.more_transforms()
    result.to_csv("result.csv")

run()
```

We switch it to pluggable Pandas, and add some annotations:

```python
from bearcat import pandas as pd, record_value

def run():
    df = pd.from_csv("my.csv")
    record_value(initial=df)
    intermediate_df = df.transform().another_transform()
    record_value(intermediate=intermediate_df)
    result = intermediate_df.more_transforms()
    record_value(result=result)
    result.to_csv("result.csv")

run()
```

And then run a diff:

```shell-session
$ bearcat-diff --version-a pandas==1.1.0 --version-b=modin==0.8.1 yourscript.py
```

This will run the script twice, once with each library plugged in as `bearcat.pandas`, and then do a diff.

## Implementation discussions

### Supporting multiple libraries

Different versions of Pandas requires multiple virtualenvs.
In theory this is not the case for e.g. Modin vs Pandas, except in practice Modin requires a particular version of Pandas that not might match what the user is currently using.

### Tracking intermediate data

Conditionals and loops means just a naive recording of values will become hard to understand when the code gets larger.
A better model might be [Eliot's tree of actions](https://eliot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html); Eliot may well allow be a good basis for implementation.

### Long-term support

Doing the annotation and changes once is fine, but... you upgrade from Pandas 1.0 to 1.1.
In three months you want to upgrade to 1.2â€”you shouldn't have to do all the annotation work from scratch.

There are two parts, the import and the annotation code.

* Using Eliot means annotation code is actually useful outside of Bearcat, just for debugging, though perhaps with a different output format, and in a way that doesn't hit performance.
  So could just leave that in.
* The `pandas` import is trickier.

Some solutions for the latter:

1. Just have users do it each time.
2. Have users rely on Bearcat for production use as well.
3. Change `sys.modules["pandas"]` to be Bearcat and then you can just stick to `import pandas`; this would likely break e.g. Modin, so probably not actually realistic.
