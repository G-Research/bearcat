## Initial use cases

### Can you upgrade Pandas?

Your code is running with Pandas version X, now you want to upgrade to version X+1.
How do you know your code is still giving the same results?

### Can you switch implementations?

There are other implementations of Pandas: cuDF, Dask, Koalas, Modin.
Can you switch to another implementation and still get the same results?
